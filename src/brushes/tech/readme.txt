19 brushes of medium size, very usefull for modern designs about technical topics. Can be used with Photoshop CS3 and up.Free to use both for personal and commercial projects.

By commercial use, I mean you can use them in an website, leaflet, poster, cards, etc. but you can't repackage them and sell them by themselves.
Also I'll be happy if you send me a message and show me what you did with them.

To install the brushes you need to do the following:
1. Unpack the .zip file;
2. Copy the .abr file
3. Paste it in the 'Presets' directory of your main Photoshop program folder, under the subdirectory 'Brushes'. For example, I can find my brushes here:
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS3\Presets\Brushes
Enjoy!
